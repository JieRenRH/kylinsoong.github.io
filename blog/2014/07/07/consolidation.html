<p>Today I&#39;ve relaunched (yet again) my blog.</p>

<p>I&#39;m trying to retire my old <em>fnokd.com</em> domain, because it&#39;s hard to
type, hard to spell, and doesn&#39;t really mean anything.</p>

<p>So, in trying to shuffled everything over to <em>mcwhirter.org</em>, I&#39;ve
now got the Fnokd! site ported over to <a href="http://awestruct.org/">Awestruct</a>.</p>

<p>This includes some modifications to Awestruct to support cool stuff like
<a href="/blog/tags">tag clouds</a>.  Pretty happy with how dynamic a static site can 
be.  Mix in <a href="http://intensedebate.com/">IntenseDebate</a> for comments, and
a pile of static files works impressively well.</p>

<p>For those of you keeping track at home, that means you can find stuff
I write here and at a variety of other places:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://cloudpress.org/">http://cloudpress.org/</a></li>
<li><a href="http://torquebox.org/">http://torquebox.org/</a></li>
<li><a href="http://rubyunderground.org/">http://rubyunderground.org/</a></li>
<li><a href="http://awestruct.org/">http://awestruct.org/</a></li>
</ul>
