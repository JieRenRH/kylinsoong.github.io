## Materialized Views

Teiid Materialized views are just like other views, but their transformations are pre-computed and stored just like a regular table. When queries are issued against the views through the Teiid Server, the cached results are used.

There are 2 categories of Materialization:

* External Materialization - External materialized views cache their data in an external database system. External materialized views give the administrator full control over the loading and refresh strategies.
* Internal Materialization - Internal materialization creates Teiid temporary tables to hold the materialized table. While these tables are not fully durable, they perform well in most circumstances and the data is present at each Teiid instance which removes the single point of failure and network overhead of an external database. Internal materialization also provides more built-in facilities for refreshing and monitoring. 

Detailed documentation from [Teiid doc](https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/TEIID/Materialized+Views).
